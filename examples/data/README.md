# Examples

Right now, the examples require a vectorized form of WebKB, which is too large to check
in to git.  However, you can [download the corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~webkb/) and
run our [python extractor](https://github.com/buddha314/numsuch/blob/master/utils/dataprep/prepare_webkb_data.py) on it if you like.
