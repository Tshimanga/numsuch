Behold, the Graph Entropy Module.  A nice introduction to this idea is
available from `Dr. Cho at Baylor University <http://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/cho/Cho-Entropy.pdf>`_

.. function:: proc subgraphEntropy(G: Graph, verts: domain)

   
   Find the entropy of a given subgraph
   

.. function:: proc vertexLocalEntropy(v: VertexData, interior: domain)

   
     Finds the entropy around a specific vertex by calculating the total weight of
     the interior and exterior edges, then applying a log multinomial
   
   .. math::
     e = p_{interior} log p_{interior}
   
      

.. function:: proc minimalSubGraph(G: Graph, interior: domain)

   
   Try to find the smallest graph to express this set of nodes, eliminating ones that
   don't add entropy
   
   :param G: The parent Graph object
   :param interior: The vertex ids for the subgraph in question
