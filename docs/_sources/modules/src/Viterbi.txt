Viterbi
=======
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use Viterbi;

.. function:: proc Viterbi(observations: [], states: [], initialProbabilities: [], transitionProbabilities: [], emissionProbabilities: [])

   
   Basic implementation of the [Viterbi Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm)
   Note the ``observations`` and ``states`` are assume to be an array of strings.  Future implementations
   may send a flag
   
   :arg observations: A sequence of observed states. Assumed to be an array of strings.
   :arg states: An array of hidden state names, assumed to be strings
   :arg initialProbabilities: A probability distribution over the hidden states
   :arg transitionProbabilities: Transition matrix for hidden state to hidden state
   :arg emissionProbabilities: Probabilites mapping hidden state -> observed state
