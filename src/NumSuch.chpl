 It would be fun to do some math! But not yet I guess

 Let's try out a code block:

 .. code-block:: chapel

    var d: domain(1) = {1..71};

 */
module NumSuch{
  use LinearAlgebra,
      Core,
      GraphUtils,
      PeelPropagation,
      GraphEntropy,
      Stats;

  proc main() {
    writeln("don't expect much...");
  }
}
