# NumSuch
Porting little bits of code I need from NumPy over to Chapel

Documents, such as they are, should be available [here](https://buddha314.github.io/numsuch/).

This is an attempt to collect numerical tools into [Chapel](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel) libraries.
It's a purely amateur effort, since I am by no means a numerical programmer.

Let's be bold.  Let's do [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) + [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) + [Keras](https://keras.io/) all at once.

## Why Chapel?

Because it works. I'm finding myself laughing out loud at 2 AM saying "I can't believe that worked the first time!".  And it feels like the love child of Python (mom) and Fortran (dad), the two greatest languages
ever invented.

## NNModels

Algorithms are based on Section 6.5 of "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville.  See 1st Ed. page 202
