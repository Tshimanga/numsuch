# NumSuch
Porting little bits of code I need from NumPy over to Chapel

This is an attempt to collect numerical tools into [Chapel](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel) libraries.
It's a purely amateur effort, since I am by no means a numerical programmer.

Let's mirror [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) where we can.
